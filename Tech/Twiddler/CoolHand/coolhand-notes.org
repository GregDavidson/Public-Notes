* Twidder Notes

** New Default Mode

Start with CoolHand, get left/right intuitive

Add trailing spaces to ,;:!?&|)]}

Create a binding for .<space>

Alternatively, have Shift version of these keys produce <space>key<space>

** New Numeric Mode

Use middle column for binary encoding of numbers with 10 -> 0

Use another column for F1 through F12

Use the rest for the other non-control non-graphic function keys

** Improved Shift Mode

Use shift of non-letter characters to produce something useful!

** Control-, Shift-, Alt-, etc. prefix keys?

If Twiddler can't do it, do it in Emacs, as that's the only
program that will want them, anyway!
