**Tip:** type capital letters without touching CapsLock or Shift

assign a chord with the following keystrokes  

    <Escape>~a

This sequence does the following:
- switch from insert mode to command mode (this leaves the cursor on the previously type letter)
- change the case of the letter
- switch back to insert mode (continue to type)



**Tip:** copy last word for later pasting

assign a chord with the following keystrokes  

    <Escape>yiw`.a

This sequence does the following:
- switch from insert mode to command mode (this leaves the cursor on the previously type letter)
- copy the word just typed (yank inner word, cursor now on the first letter of the word copied)
- return cursor to previous position
- switch back to insert mode (continue to type)
                 
 *use `p` to paste when in command mode*.


The copied word can also be stored in a named register.
      
    # copy last word into the register a:
    <Escape>"ayiw`.a
    
    # paste the content of register a:
    "ap
