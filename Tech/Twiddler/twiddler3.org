*** Procedure for upgrading

https://twiddler.tekgear.com/doc/doku.php?id=firmwareupgrade

Procedure for upgrading:

-Preparing for the Upgrade
--Plug into USB.
--Identify which firmware you are running by pressing N+S 0R00.
--Download and unzip the latest firmware here: Twiddler Firmware
--Plug the Twiddler into a computer via USB, mount the flash drive, and copy the Twiddler_0.XXu.hex file to it.
--Rename the .hex file to twiddler.hex.
--Eject the flash drive using the OS's Eject function. It is critical that the .hex file is fully written to the drive so gracefully ejecting the drive is critical.
--Power off the Twiddler.
--Disconnect USB from Twiddler.
-Begin the Upgrade
--Make sure the Twiddler is unplugged from USB and remains unplugged in during the entire procedure.
--Hold down N+S and power on the Twiddler. This will load the factory boot image. To verify this, type N+S 0R00. “Version x.xxb” should be typed out. (x.xx are numbers)
--To start the upgrade procedure type N+S 000R.
--The LED on the Twiddler will blink Red and Yellow during the upgrade. Do not plug in or turn off the Twiddler during this time.
--Upon completion, The Twiddler will “reboot” and the LED will remain a solid color.
--Plug the Twiddler back into USB or connect via Bluetooth.
--Press N+S 0R00 to check to see if the new version has been installed correctly. It should type out “Version x.xx*u*” where x.xx is the version number of the firmware you downloaded.
