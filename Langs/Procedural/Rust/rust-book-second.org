** Interior Mutability with RefCell

This should allow me to create global statics
which must be initialized during the program
initialization phase!

init_state: InitState;
foo: static1<Foo>(&init_state);


main() {
  init();
	foo.set(Foo.new(whatever));
	init_state.next();
	doit_to_a_foo( foo.get() ); OK
}
