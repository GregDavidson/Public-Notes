* Racket Graphics Notes

** Questions

How can Racket represent Graphical Objects?
- Bitmaps
      - supposedly only when loading an existing bitmap file
      - or explicitly rendering such
- SVG or other Functional Representations?
- Postscript-like operation sequences?
- Constraint-based Functional Objects?

More Packages

- [[https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/pict3d][Pict3D]]
      - failing as of [2023-11-24 Fri 00:52]
      - issue posted Nov 2022
- [[https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/metapict][Metapict]]

What rendering libraries does Racket use?
- Can everything use Cairo?
- GPU-based rendering?

What's with the snip% representation?

** Impressions

Racket has many different kinds of Graphical Objects.
- These objects are instances of %snip classes?
- There is a convert protocol for converting among them

Conversions seem to be mostly for creating files?

Graphical Objects are a tree of operations with primitives as leaves.
If the leaves are the result of image constructors then the whole
tree is declarative?

The 2 current standard functional picture libraries
- [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/pict][pict]]
      - [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/pict/Pict_Datatype.html][pict datatype]]
- 2htdp/image teachpack
      - [[https://download.racket-lang.org/releases/8.11/doc/teachpack/2htdpimage-guide.html][Image Guide]]
      - [[https://download.racket-lang.org/releases/8.11/doc/teachpack/2htdpimage.html][2httpd/image teachpack]]

How are these different?
- How and when can we convert between them?
- pict-convert failed on PLANE
      - PLANE was a loaded bitmap
      - Maybe only works for constructed images?

We've got
- 2D Picts
- 2htdp 2D Images

- file:///usr/share/doc/racket/teachpack/2htdpimage.html
- 3D Picts
- Metapict

- [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/svg-dc_.html][svg class]]
      - Seems to be only for creating files

[[https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui][Graphical Interface Toolkit]]
- may have / explain key gui features

Internal Formats for Graphical Objects
- Bitmap
- Postscript-like operations?
      - maybe for operators
