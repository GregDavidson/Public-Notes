**  SELECT DISTINCT collapses NULLs!
https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-select-distinct/
#+begin_src 
#+end_src
** BETWEEN with timestamps excludes high end?
In the example
#+begin_src sql
SELECT
   customer_id,
   payment_id,
   amount,
 payment_date
FROM
   payment
WHERE
   payment_date BETWEEN '2007-02-07'
AND '2007-02-15';
#+end_src
we don't see any dates on 2007-02-15 even though they exist because
#+begin_src sql
select cast( '2007-02-15' as timestamp);
#+end_src
returns
| timestamp           |
