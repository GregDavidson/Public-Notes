- degree in Mathematical Physics from UT
- technically rigorous coverage of
      - theoretical physics, consciousness, ai, God

*** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p_Hlm6aCok][Leonard Susskind Interview with Curt Jaimungal]]

- title :: The Crisis in String Theory is Worse Than You Think...

- Susskind "kind of" recanting or backing off of his prior position
- "String Theory with a capital S is not the real world we live in"
- Except as an existence proof that QM and Relativity can be reconciled
      - just not this way!
- Talks about De Sitter Space and the Holographic Principle
- Would there be a DS-CFT correspondence? :: No
- Young People [mathematical physicists] tell him that it's too hard to work in this area
- yet it's going to have to be Young People moving us forward
- although it's "possible that inflation could be wrong"
      - inflation is pretty well supported by the evidence
      - the scientific consensus tends to be right
- Penrose "believes all kinds of things" that the consensus doesn't subscribe to

Sir Roger Penrose is a renowned physicist and mathematician known for pioneering
the theory of twistors and his contributions to differential geometry, which
have significantly impacted our understanding of space-time. Roger's work has
been instrumental in advancing theories related to general relativity and
quantum mechanics, including the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems.
