* Notes on Miscellaneous Things

These notes are primarily for myself, as a reminder of features which I want to
remember about various things. Some of these notes could possibly be helpful to
others - perhaps you! - especially when I give a reference to specific notes. I
will make a modest effort to make them intelligible to others and I make no
promises as to the result of such! Feel free to clone any of these files and
feel free to send me pull requests if you have a sense that you've significantly
extended their utility.
