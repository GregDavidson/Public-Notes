** Termux Notes

* ip command is gone
[2023-02-27]

- My go-sshd script calls ip but that command seems to be gone
- I used ifconfig manually instead
- I tried to install ip and it wasn't found

* copying a tree with tar and sshd had issues
[2023-02-27]

I did
#+begin_src sh
tar cf - .emacs.d .spacemacs | ssh -ax -p 8022 10.106.219.137 tar xvf -
#+end_src

The .x was required to avoid the error
#+begin_example
X11 forwarding request failed on channel 0
#+end_example

The ~-a~ was likely not needed.

I had some confusion with the link
- .emacs.d/private/JGD
