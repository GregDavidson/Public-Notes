* psql client for PostgreSQL Notes

** Show psql Hidden Magic

- -E :: option argument
- --echo-hidden :: long argument
- \set ECHO_HIDDEN=on :: within session

Echo the SQL queries generated by \d and other backslash commands.

** psql variables

- :name :: name expanded in command
- ':name' :: not expanded in literal quotes
- \:name :: not expanded
- :'name' :: expansion literal quoted
- :"name" :: expansion identifier quoted
- :{?name} :: expands to TRUE if name exists, FALSE otherwise
- expanded before being sent to PostgreSQL
      - PostgreSQL doesn't know about them
- can contain letters, digits, and underscores and are case-sensitive
- some are special - see man page for list
      - some control psql's behavior
      - some are automatically set to reflect connection state

*** Assigning via Command Arguments

- -v var=value :: sets
- -v var= :: sets to empty
- -v var :: unsets

Caveat in manual:
- variables that reflect connection state will get overwritten later

*** Assigning in session

- \set :: list all variables with their values
- \set name :: set name to empty-string
- \set name value... :: set name to concatenation of values
- \unset name :: unset variable name

*** See also

- \gset
- \setenv
- Use of variables in \if expressions
