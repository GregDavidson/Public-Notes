* Emacs Lisp Notes

** Global Variables

- defvar :: declare global variable
						- only assigns value if variable is void, i.e. single-assignment
- defconst :: declare global "constant"
- boundp :: is symbol's value-cell non-void?
- makunbound :: make symbol's value-cell void
- symbol-value :: fetch global value of symbol

symbol-value is useful when the symbol might be shadowed.

When a package is configured by a global value and it wants to compile cleanly and not overwrite that value when customized:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
	(defvar *foo-1* (if (not (boundp '*foo-1*)) 0 (+ 1 (symbol-value '*foo-1*))))
#+END_SRC

* Files

Remove symlinks in paths:
- file-chase-links :: last path component normalized
- file-truename :: all path components normalized
Check existence and kind of file:
- file-regular-p :: does the path exist as a regular file?
- file-directory-p :: does the path exist as a regular file?
