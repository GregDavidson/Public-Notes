** Evil Issues
How can I make Evil behave more like Vi?
- . doesn't repeat insertions
- < and > don't seem to select the lines I need

** Problem Reports

On 3 November 2021 I downloaded spacemacs anew.  I'm using development mode.  When it rebuilt it said:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Warning (evil-collection): `evil-want-keybinding' was set to nil but not before loading evil.

Make sure to set `evil-want-keybinding' to nil before loading evil or evil-collection.

See https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection/issues/60 for more details.
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Setting Environment Variables at Startup

Spacemacs is giving me this message:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
You appear to be setting environment variables ("PATH") in your .bashrc or .zshrc: those files are only read by interactive shells, so you should instead set environment variables in startup files like .profile, .bash_profile or .zshenv.  Refer to your shell’s man page for more info.  Customize ‘exec-path-from-shell-arguments’ to remove "-i" when done, or disable ‘exec-path-from-shell-check-startup-files’ to disable this message.
#+END_EXAMPLE

=org-list-indent-offset= is a variable defined in ‘org-list.el’.
- Additional indentation for sub-items in a list.
  - By setting this to a small number
     - usually 1 or 2
  - one can more clearly distinguish sub-items in a list.

** Evil Ideas

From [[https://web.archive.org/web/20180723155724/http://makble.com/how-to-toggle-evil-mode-in-emacs][How To Toggle Evil Mode In Emacs]]
#+begin_src elisp
  defun toggle-evilmode ()
  (interactive)
  (if (bound-and-true-p evil-local-mode)
    (progn
      ; go emacs
      (evil-local-mode (or -1 1))
      (undo-tree-mode (or -1 1))
      (set-variable 'cursor-type 'bar)
    )
    (progn
      ; go evil
      (evil-local-mode (or 1 1))
      (set-variable 'cursor-type 'box)
    )
  )
)
 
(global-set-key (kbd "M-u") 'toggle-evilmode)
#+end_src

** Things Not Working

*** ob-racket not working
- it's not getting loaded

#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'ob-racket)
#+end_src

*** ob-prolog not working
Current Status
- commented out in .spacemacs

** My Hacks

Following
- [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/22338/spacemacs-move-org-mode-customization-to-separate-file][StackExchange: Spacemacs - move org-mode customization to separate file]]
I added code in .spacemacs to look for
- a subdirectory called extra in every layer
- put it on the load-path if it's found
