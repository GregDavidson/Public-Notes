* Marvin Minsky Quotes

** A Computer Is Like A Violin

A computer is like a violin. You can imagine a novice trying first a phonograph
and then a violin. The latter, he says, sounds terrible. That is the argument we
have heard from our humanists and most of our computer scientists. Computer
programs are good, they say, for particular purposes, but they aren't flexible.
Neither is a violin, or a typewriter, until you learn how to use it.

Marvin Minsky, “Why Programming Is a Good Medium for Expressing
Poorly-Understood and Sloppily-Formulated Ideas” in Design and Planning, (1967)
